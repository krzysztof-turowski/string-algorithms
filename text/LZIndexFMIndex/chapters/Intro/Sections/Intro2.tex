\section{Usage of string-searching in practice}
String-searching is used in many areas of IT and the easiest algorithms to solve those problems are already implemented in some programming languages by default \cite{stringSearchingUsage} \cite{Gusfield1997AlgorithmsOS}. String-searching can be used in:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Spell Checker
    \item Spam Filter
    \item Intrusion Detection System Model 
    \item Search Engine Module
    \item Plagiarism Detection System
    \item DNA Sequencing Module
    \item Digital Forensic Results
    \item Information Retrieval Modal
    \item Databases
    \item Search tools, such as grep
    \item Educational CD-ROM applications
    \item Internet browsers and crawlers
\end{itemize}

As can be seen, a lot of branches requires to solve that problem and many of them are commonly used in the daily life.
